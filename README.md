## Week 01

### Tuesday 
* Create an explanation about interpreted And Compiled programming Languages 

For starters it's necessary to understand that most languages can have both but they tend to work better with one. Each one have their own ways to manipulate the written code in order to let the computer understand and process the code. To make ourselves clear of what it's the difference between them we'll use two scenarios to see the process. 
In the first scenario we have a code that it's written in a compiled language, first we need to translate every line of code with a compiler and then create a separate code that it's now translated, this new code it's what be call an executable file. 

In the other scenario we have a code that we want to run so we handle to the other person a copy ofthe code, with the help of a interpreter we translate a line and execute it and repeat the procces for each line until we reach the end of the code. 

* Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both? 

We can determine that Java is both a compiled and an interpreted language, it mainly depend on our execution environment. We use Java language to code, then a compiler create a file with bytecode, then that file it's going to be either translated by another compiler or it's going to be  executed by an interpreter.

* Pseudocode exercise 
>For this exercise will be getting the valu of the two variables because bitcoin fluctuates 

 START
amount<--GET

bitcoinReferenceInDollars<--GET

bitcoinConvertion<-- amount/bitcoinReferenceInDollars

PRINT bitcoinConvertion

END

* High and low level languages 


Since our tech devices only understand binary and binary it's very complicated for us to write code, so, we had to find a way to make ourselves able to communicate with the device and then the first language created was an intermediate between us and the PC. That first language was assembly language that was less close to our human way of communicate, it had some reserved words and symbols.
That first language is part of what we call low level languages
Low level languages are called that way because it's a low abstraction of machine language, it means that the language it's pretty close to machine language.
In the other hand we have high level languages that are closer to the way we communicate, by that we mean that it has it's own rules and grammatic.
